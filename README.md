# Fluttter-Udemy

This repo is for the mini-projects that I've been setting up as part of the Udemy course:
* [The Complete 2020 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/)

I am also fairly inexperienced with GitHub in general. I wanted to have each project in a folder, and merge each folder into the master branch to minimize the number of branches. However, apparently I approached that incorrectly. Now I have separate branches for each mini-project. Not a big deal, just not what I was going for.
